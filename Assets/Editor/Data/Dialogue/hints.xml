  You can now specify summaries with the <success> and <failure> tags! These will appear after a smuggling run. They do not have to
  always be defined, as they can come from many places. In the off chance there are no summaries that are generated, that's fine too!
  
  As always, you can use %constructs% just like in hints and bio.
